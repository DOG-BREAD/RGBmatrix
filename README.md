# RGBmatrix
Python samples created from Hans Zeller RGB Matrix repository

These samples include a simulated rain, simulated blizzard, spiral pattern, random pattern generation, and GIF presentation.

This was accomplished using a RGB matrix, ADA fruit RTC-HAT and a rasperry pi 4

The demo is here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN9kdvvfdj4
The portions that I created are described in the word document. Set up is straight forward.
